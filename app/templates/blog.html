		<h3>2013</h3>

			<h4> I can't believe it's over, but it is. There's no other way of putting it: my 10 weeks is up, and I no longer have the daily structure and constant community support of Hackbright v3.0. But the structure and support will be there still, I know.</h4>
			<h4>It has been splendorous and beautiful and scary. I can say that because I sit here throwing up a bit of text onto the interwebs, early on a Friday night, the whirlwind of the last 10 weeks having finally revealed itself as a beautiful watercolor tornado, made of bandwidth and Zed Shaw, and machine learning tutorials and github and Union Square and coffee. A lot of Coffee. Tonight at Hackbright, people are skittering about our office flat, in and out of rooms, lounging, watching chick flicks, practicing list operations, and saying a few goodbyes.</h4>
			<h4> I'm trying to stay focused because everyday new opportunities abound, and the real meaning of all this sentimentality about Hackbright is that I have a new pair of sunglasses that blocks out all the boring stuff and lets in all the cool stuff. I'm trying to say I can look at the world in a new way now. This new pair of sunglasses happens to pair with hoodies quite nicely. That was very corny.</h4>

    <section class="notcenter">
        <h4> I've been interviewing for software engineering jobs for the last two weeks now. The following Monday after Hackbright ended saw the first interview, and then one on Wednesday, Friday, Monday, and Wednesday again. I've had overall positive experiences; I'm surprised at how much I'm able to accomplish during the technical component. I tend to work slowly (I imagine) and ask many questions. Teasing out a solution is a rush, actually. As opposed to the idea in my head- a quiz-like setting - I am the only one playing for my own team, and it's as if the interviewer isn't event there. Sort of.</h4>
        <h4> I haven't been applying any filter for the jobs I apply to as of yet. I will start that this week, though. Now that I've conquered, to an extent, the fear of interviewing, I'm intent on finding the infamous "Good Fit" in terms of location and job expectations. </h4>
        <h4> A lot of the advice I get about getting an engineering job tends to make me feel like I should forget everything I ever knew about myself. I incur the identity of some generic starting engineer, who can and can't understand certain things about what will happen next. I've accepted this fate, in a sense, because it calms me down. I'm not alone then, ergonomically waiting to speak with the next CEO or VP of engineering. And yet, I hope for a greater level of caution on my part, in terms of where I go next. </h4>

        <h4> It's funny that I find myself in my current position-- I work at Hackbright now, as a software engineer (read: "high duchess of code"). It's funny to read what I wrote above. It feels nice enough to read it that I want to write more, here. A lot has happened since I last wrote on this blog but that's not going to stop me now, I suppose. I sit here on a cold summer night (dammit, San Francisco) at a Women Who Code algorithms meetup, at Hackbright. Hackbright offers up the classroom from time to time for groups of women who are teaching themselves (and each other) how to code (or how to analyze the efficiency of code, in this case). It's one of the simplest things that Hackbright can contribute to the many people who are hailed by careers in tech - space to learn. I usually have to drag myself to events like this. They're immeasurably useful, and I'm always happy that I went, but getting to the point of walking through the door is difficult. 
        The spirit of the conversations is so lively, though. As opposed to the palpable glazing over of eyes or waving of hands that happens when you try to ask anyone (really, anyone, even other software engineers) about specific details regarding mathematic proofs for big-oh notation. Even if I know the other person might have useful information, sometimes I'm too tired to be clever enough to get it out of them. Or I don't want to make myself look stupid. Or make them feel stupid for not knowing. Or some other inevitably justifiable reason. The point I'm really trying to make, though, is that after a few minutes at the Algorithms meetup, you realize these people really do want to have those conversations, that despite being in very different positions, you are both probably on some conversational level of understanding so that you can talk to them about the stuff you're learning. It's remarkable all the excuses I can make in my head now about why I can't learn this or that. Experiences in group learning highlight that fact; I try to notice it without judgement, just notice it because that's the way it is, learning stuff in adulthood.
        Hackbright was a particular brand of something today. It was the first day of the new class, Summer 2014. I think it's class #7, which is remarkable to me and something to celebrate. I gave a talk that's tentatively titled The Feelings Talk, a talk aimed at illuminating some things about the Hackbright experience that new students may or may not need to hear. I struggled with giving it because I studied feminism in college, and I find myself wanting to "do feminism" in front of the students, which for me always comes out all wonky, like someone made a 90s style hip hop track where all the rappers take turns, featuring some of my favorite feminists who, if you put in a room together, might sip their americano/green tea/water/kombucha/oxygen politely so as to avoid unproductive conversations. Alas, I did get through it (surprise, surprise). </section>
